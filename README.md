This data is of global weather ,it contains 41 columns ,contains no null values,and no duplicates.
Firstly i have identified top 10 countries with highest average temperature.
Then i have collected top 10 countries of air quality greater then 2.5
Then i have collected countries of average wind speed and average pressure and arranged it in descending order.
Then i have applied algorithm and found good accuracy in random forest regressor.
i have selected latitude ,longitude, humidity  as most relevant columns and is related to the temperature.
I have found out 86% accuracy in random forest regressor algorithm.
